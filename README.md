# DRV8323S_BreakoutBoard

Simple DRV8323S Breakout board. 
Untested and designed by someone with little experience. Use at your own risk.

30v 60a mosfets. I dont recommend pushing the board that hard however.

I'll probably post updates with safe limits for the board as I test it.

The DRV8323S supports using the fets as current shunts. Cut the three jumpers and short the current shunts if you want to try that.
